# Functional-Light JavaScript
# Chapter 11: Putting It All Together

By now, you have everything you need to understand functional-light JavaScript. There's no more new concepts to introduce.

So, in this final chapter, we're just going to try and build some cohesiveness by examining examples that bring all the major themes from this book together. Think of this chapter as the application of what we've learned so far.

You'll want to take these examples and practice them and try them yourself, extensively. Simply stopping with this book without this chapter will leave you short of my goal of getting your code to benefit more from FP principles.
